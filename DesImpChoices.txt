Design Choices:

I chose to make the generated report very bare bones. I did this because in my experience most institutions keep their reports very simple and to the point, so I thought that adding any unnecessary details would be unrealistic. 

As for the design of the code itself, the way I wrote the code is simply how I am used to writing and reading code.


Implementation Choices:

Honestly for the most part I chose to implement certain parts of the code the way I did because it was the way I understood the best. There were multiple times when asking AI such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and even Claude, how I could improve the efficiency of my code by shortening it or making it simpler and it would recommend something that made absolutely no sense at all. 

But there were multiple instances where AI was used to help me make the code shorter and more efficient. I commented on the source code wherever these instances occurred, while also explaining how I believed the code it recommended for me to use worked.

The line of code that took me the longest to actually understand was line 83 this was because for multiple hours I tried to get the code to read the Arrivinganimals.txt file and it just wouldn't but eventually I realized it was because I had the .txt file in the wrong folder on my computer, safe to say that taught me an extremely valuable lesson. 

Another thing I was debating on implementing was a randomly generated name for each animal using the animalNames.txt file provided but decided against it as the assignment didn't say that it was necessary, and that they only needed a name. I think if i had started this project 2 or more days prior to when I did, I most likely would have gone through with that decision.
